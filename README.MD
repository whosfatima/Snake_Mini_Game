# 🐍 Snake Mini Game

A mini snake-like game made with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, built from scratch with love, logic, and late-night coding. 🧠💪💤

## 🚀 What’s this?

This is **my very first game attempt**, inspired by the classic Snake.  
The logic is built using `setInterval`, `keydown` events, and **collision detection** with food items.  
Each time the red square (a.k.a. the “snake”) eats a black square (the “food”), the score increases and a new food item appears randomly on the screen. 💥

## 🎮 Controls

Use your **arrow keys** to move the red box:

## 🧠 Dev Notes

This project was created to practice:

- DOM manipulation
- Keyboard events
- Timing functions
- Random positioning logic
- Game state management

And to be honest, I *enjoyed building it more than playing it.* 😁
