# 🎮 RedBox Move

A tiny, keyboard-controlled moving box made with HTML, CSS & JavaScript — and a whole lotta love.  
This is the **first spark** of a bigger dream: building real games, from scratch, with joy and madness.  
Built in the middle of doubt, with a smile that came right after pressing `ArrowRight`.

## ✨ Features

## ❤️ About the Vibe

This project is more than a moving square.  
It's a **first step** toward something bigger — maybe a full-blown game, maybe just a playground to express logic and motion.

> Created late at night, by someone who needed to **feel alive** through code.  
> Built with love, made with courage, and moved by the arrow keys of fate.

## 🛸 What's Next?

- Add wall collision detection  
- Introduce score, goals or obstacles  
- Build a basic maze or challenge  
- Or maybe... let it grow into a real game 👾

Because sometimes, moving a little red box... **is just the beginning.**
